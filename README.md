<h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Phil ðŸ‘‹</h2>
Iâ€™m an aspiring software developer and cybersecurity professional who is passionate about creating innovative solutions and learning new skills.
<h2>All of my prestigious GitHub contributions are in private repos that I canâ€™t publish and in organizations that do not show my contributions on my main profile.</h2>
<h2>ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m currently working on</h2>
Iâ€™m solo learning web development frameworks like React, which is a powerful library for building user interfaces.
Iâ€™m also exploring the field of cybersecurity and how to protect systems and data from malicious attacks in my free time from school.
